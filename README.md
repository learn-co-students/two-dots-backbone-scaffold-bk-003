# Two Dots

![two dots picture](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/web-dev-readme-photos/js/two-dots.png)

## Objective

Your task is to make a functioning version of the popular iPhone/Android app [Two Dots](https://apps.facebook.com/twodotsweb/) on Backbone.

Dots of the same color that are in the same row or the same column should be able to be connected by clicking down on one, dragging the mouse over to the next one, and unclicking the mouse.

[Here's](https://youtu.be/vgG223cMmE4?t=1m3s) a video of a player going through the first few levels of Two Dots. It might even be worth it to download the app (it's free!) and play a few rounds just so know know what you're trying to build.

## Bonus

* Make it possible for players to backtrack their steps or "undo" their play. 
* When a user makes a square, or any shape that connects back on itself, delete all dots of the color of the shape. For instance, red square deletes all the red from the board and no red dots exist after making it.
